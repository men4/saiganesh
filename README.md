1.List is used to store multiple items of the same and different data type under a variable. It is basically an array. We can perform various operations on it, such as     .map() to loop over the list/array to list down all the elements.
  The wrappedListComponent returns a memorized components list. By memorized, it ensures that it doesn't re-render unnecessarily.
  That is, if the component's props don't change, it doesn't re-render. The memo is used to improve the speed and performance of the website. As long as the title and     release date properties are the same between renderings, React reuses the memorized content.
